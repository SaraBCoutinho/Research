# 2021.1_RedesNeurais

Project develloped during the neural network course of the pos-graduation program at Cin-UFPE. 

Semester: 2020.2

Group: Adriano Marabuco, Jair Paulino, Sara Coutinho. 


Focusing on the actual problem of traffic accidents, we idealized one solution to solve this base on the velocity data. 
We did a study considering the spatial-temporal vision, focusing on data from Recife-Brazil, and the window time considering 12 hours. 
We did a neural network to modeling the solution using input, based on velocite data, and output , based on accident registers.
